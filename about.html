                <h1>Objective</h1>
                    <p>The objectvie of this visualization is to provide the user insight on the changing surface temperatures in the last 150 years.</p>
                <h1>Structure</h1>
                    <p>The structure of this project is an interactive slide show of 2 slides.
                      The slides are driven by the author with navigational buttons indicating the different scenes of this project. Each page allows the user to further understand
                      the data either by exploring different latitudes to see whether the sea-surface temperature
                      deviations from the average temperature or reading the annotations on the overview.</p>
                <h1>Scene Utilizations</h1>
                    <p>The first scene is an overview of the dataset.
                      It shows the deviations of surface temperatures from a global point of view.
                      This scene also includes annotations that will provide some background information and
                      further insight of the overview. In the second scene, the user is able to change the
                      y-axis to see the deviations of surface temperature from different latitudes around the
                      globe. This allows the user to really understand the general trend of the change of
                      surface temperatures over the course of 150 years.
                    </P>
                <h1>Use of Annotations</h1>
                    <p>There are 2 annotations in the overview scene of this project. One explains how the
                      dataset standardizes the deviations which helps the user understand the data. The other
                      annotation discusses an observation of the trend in the dataset.</p>
                <h1>Use of Parameters</h1>
                    <p>In the second scene, the parameters are the different latitudes available for the user
                      to pick to further investigate this dataset. The latitudes are given in ranges and some
                      examples are the Southern Hemisphere, the Equator, and 24N to 90N.</p>
                <h1>Use of Triggers</h1>
                    <p>The triggers in this narrative visualization is when the user clicks on which specific
                      latitude range to filter the second visualization. The author has provided the user
                      the on the location of the trigger and how the user can use the trigger to his or her
                      advantage.</p>
